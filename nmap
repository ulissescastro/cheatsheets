### Nmap Scripting Engine Categories
The most common Nmap scripting engine categories:
- auth: Utilize credentials or bypass authentication on target hosts.
- broadcast: Discover hosts not included on command line by broadcasting on local network.
- brute: Attempt to guess passwords on target systems, for a variety of protocols, including http, SNMP, IAX, MySQL, VNC, etc.
- default: Scripts run automatically when -sC or -A are used.
- discovery: Try to learn more information about target hosts through public sources of information, SNMP, directory services, and more.
- dos: May cause denial of service conditions in target hosts.
- exploit: Attempt to exploit target systems.
- external: Interact with third-party systems not included in target list.
- fuzzer: Send unexpected input in network protocol fields.
- intrusive: May crash target, consume excessive resources, or otherwise impact target machines in a malicious fashion.
- malware: Look for signs of malware infection on the target hosts.
- safe: Designed not to impact target in a negative fashion.
- version: Measure the version of software or protocols on the target hosts.
- vul: Measure whether target systems have a known vulnerability.
